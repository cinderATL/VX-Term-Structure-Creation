This is not the complete set of VX files you should have.
After cleaning the RAW directory files as per instructions, move them here to begin the analysis.
They all should have a one line header and no index
You should have all the terms and years 2004 - 2020
You will have several 2021 files (about 5 of them) since some contracts are already in their 2021 year
